# readme is a Work in Progress

keep in mind you will have to add your own emote music, ids, and traversal stuff, I might update this to add presets except for music

Originally I tried forking the default roblox animate script, but the code was so messy it made me switch over to using MaximumADHD's rewrite instead as a basis with some modifications to the emote system

you are allowed to modify this for your games

if you want to test it out play this game [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/127487059727813/roblox-animate-script-emote-revamp)

just make sure you have these emotes:
- [griddy](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/129149402922241/griddy)
- [Caramell](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/85936805522788/Caramell)
