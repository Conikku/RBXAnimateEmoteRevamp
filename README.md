# readme is a Work in Progress

keep in mind you will have to add your own emote music, ids, and traversal stuff, I might update this to add presets except for music

Originally I tried forking the default roblox animate script, but the code was so messy it made me switch over to using MaximumADHD's rewrite instead as a basis with some modifications to the emote system

you are allowed to modify this for your games
